The script AccuracyCalculation.py was created using the prompt: "Please create a script that measures a models accuracy and save the result."
The code was then edited to work as desired (Implemented NOSA models), and debugged using the built in Copilot in visual studio code. <br/><br/>
The script ComparisonWithSOTAModels.py was created using the prompt: " Please plot this data to compare the accuracy and IoU of NOSAv2 to SOTA models. The data to include is as follows: 
Enhanced U-Net: Acc 99.8, IoU 91.3;EfficientNetB4+Multi-Attention U-Net: Acc 99.8, IoU 87.9; ARU-Net: Acc 98.3, IoU 96.3; NOSAv2: Acc 98.2, IoU 32.1; Baseline U-Net: Acc 93.9, 86.6" 
The code was then edited to work as desired, and debugged using the built in Copilot in visual studio code. <br/><br/>
The script PerformanceComparisonNOSAVersions.py was created using the prompt: "Please write a script to evaluate the performance of two models using these metrics: IoU, F1 score, Precision, and recall. Plot the measured data in a boxplot, and create a line graph showing the different mean scores across versions."
The code was then edited to work as desired, and debugged using the built in Copilot in visual studio code. <br/><br/>
The script PerformanceTestHeatmap was created using the prompt: "Please write a script to evaluate the performance of a model using these metrics: IoU, F1 score, Precision, and recall with and without the heatmap enabled. Plot the measured data in a boxplot, and create a line graph showing the different mean scores across versions."
The code was then edited to work as desired, and debugged using the built in Copilot in visual studio code. <br/><br/>
